## Kanto Version
PokéRogue Kanto Version is an independently-developed branch of PokéRogue, completely overhauling the game. The existing game modes are replaced by a singular Kanto mode, which only contains the original Kanto Pokémon and characters (plus newer evolutions and forms). The game and progression have been thoroughly rebalanced.

### Features
・Regional: All biomes and trainers have been replaced with Kanto equivalents, including rival Blue and Victory Road.  

・Gym Leader Rework: Rather than facing 6 random gym leaders tied to biome, in Kanto Version all 8 gym leaders are battled in a randomised order. Gym leaders have semi-randomised specialties; for example Misty can specialise in Water-type or Ice-type Pokémon. Every gym leader and variation has a hand-crafted rarity pool that affects their random team generation. Gym leaders reward randomised TMs from a special pool when defeated.  

・Music: Kanto Version uses the FRLG and HGSS soundtracks. A setting is added to swap between them at will.  

・Rebalance: Pacing, difficulty, and metaprogression have all been reworked following a design philosophy that Pokémon is well-suited to offer a more challenging strategic gameplay experience.

・Champion Mode: A setting which autosaves every turn rather than every battle forces you to win on your first try, or else accept defeat. Ribbons can only be earned in Champion mode, and shiny rate is doubled while it is enabled. It can be turned off at any time, but once it is disabled for a given run, it can't be re-enabled for that run.  

・Achievements: Several all-new achievements for Kanto. Pokédex statistics such as Pokémon seen and caught now only track Kanto Pokémon. Take on the challenge of bringing every Pokémon to the top, if you can.
